# AIoT Hackathon Project — Emotion Recognition on ESP32

## 📌 Overview
Final hackathon project where we deployed an **emotion recognition model** directly on an ESP32-S3 device with a camera.  
The system captures frames on the ESP32, performs inference, and classifies human emotions in real time.

## 🚀 Highlights
- Implemented **deep learning–based emotion recognition** on ESP32-S3.  
- The ESP32 captures images, runs the trained model, and classifies emotions locally.  
- Built a pipeline to send predictions back to a server/PC for further actions.  
- Demonstrated real-time inference on a low-power embedded device.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- ESP32-S3 (with camera module)  
- TensorFlow Lite Micro / Edge AI deployment  
- Python (for training + server-side verification)  

## 📂 Repository
Currently, the code is stored locally.  
A public repository will be linked here once available.
