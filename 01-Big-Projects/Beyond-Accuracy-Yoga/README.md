# Beyond Accuracy — Yoga Pose Classification

**My Fork:** [TomerBenAroush/Beyond-Accuracy-Yoga-Project](https://github.com/TomerBenAroush/DeepLearningProject)  

## 📌 Overview
A deep learning project focusing on yoga pose classification. The goal was to go beyond traditional accuracy metrics and evaluate explainability and robustness.

## 🚀 Highlights
- Comparative study of multiple neural network architectures:
  - **CNN**
  - **Vision Transformer (ViT)**
  - **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**
- Applied explainability tools:
  - Grad-CAM
  - Attention maps
  - GNN Explainer
- Robustness experiments under:
  - Gaussian noise
  - Augmentations

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- PyTorch
- Kornia (data augmentation)
- Grad-CAM / explainability libraries

## 📂 Structure
The full implementation, training scripts, and reports are in my forked repo:
