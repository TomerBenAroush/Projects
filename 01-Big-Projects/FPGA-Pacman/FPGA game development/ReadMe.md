FPGA game development - PAC-MAN:

In the project, we create a PACMAN game using an FPGA board according to the given requirements.

The base game is played like the original PACMAN, but we added additional features such as:

- The ability to destroy walls.
- Ghosts that follow you.
- Random appearance of elements.
- A different scoring mechanism.
- unique sound.

Below are some images from the project:

The project was carried out using Quartus software. By dividing it into different modules and properly merging them using the software, we created the game.

Below is the rectangular schema we used to merge all the elements:
