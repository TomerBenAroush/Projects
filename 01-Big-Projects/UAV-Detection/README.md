# UAVeye — Real-Time UAV Detection

## 📌 Overview
Final project developed at the Technion (VISL lab).  
Goal: Detect and identify hostile UAVs in real time using a distributed mobile-based detection grid.

## 🚀 Highlights
- UAV detection pipeline based on **YOLOv8n**.
- Model optimized for **TensorFlow Lite** deployment on smartphones.
- Android app (Kotlin + CameraX + Compose).
- Integration with **ESP32-S3** for video streaming and inference feedback.
- Robustness testing under noise and adversarial conditions.

## 📂 Repository
Currently, the code is stored locally.  
A public repository will be linked here once available.
