Grades system in C.
About the project - System for managing students' gardes: 
The project developed a system for managing students' grades using a Shared Library of Linked Lists as an Abstract Data Type (ADT). 
With this software, faculty secretaries can input details of students, add the courses each student has taken, 
and display information on the screen.
The system allows for efficient organization and retrieval of student data, facilitating streamlined management of grades and course histories.
